## Submission information

Unless otherwise noted on the Call for Papers for the current edition of the workshop, we usually accept both short, long papers, and demo papers.
The submissions must describe original and unpublished work.

Paper length:

- Short and demo papers must be between 4 and 7 pages.
- Long papers must be between 8 and 12 pages.
- References are not included in the page count and the camera-ready versions of accepted papers will be given an additional page to address reviewer comments.

Papers should describe original unpublished work or work-in-progress and will be peer-reviewed by at least two members of the program committee in a double-blind fashion.
All accepted papers will be collected into a proceedings volume to be published both in the NEALT Proceeding Series and through the ACL anthology.

The links to the Latex and Word templates can be found below.

Papers describing systems for shared tasks associated with the workshop series should be submitted to a special track and should follow the same page restrictions as the NLP4CALL papers (in the range of 4-12 pages).
System descriptions will be reviewed by the shared task organizers.


### Templates

The NLP4CALL workshop has used its own templates since the 2023 edition.
You can find links to different versions of them below.
Submissions that do not adhere to the author guidelines will be rejected without review.

*   [LaTeX](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/sites/default/files/2023/NLP4CALL%20workshop%20template.zip)
*   [Microsoft Word](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/sites/default/files/2023/nlp4call%20template.doc)
*   [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/nlp4call-workshop-template/qqqzqqyvtqqv)

Authors are invited to submit **long** papers (8-12 pages) alternatively **short** or **demo** papers (4-7 pages), page count not including references. Please indicate one relevant paper type at submission time. Only pdf files will be accepted. Submissions will be managed through the electronic conference management system (link will be added soon). Final camera-ready versions of accepted papers will be given an additional page to address reviewer comments.

Papers should describe original unpublished work or work-in-progress. Every paper will be reviewed by at least 2 members of the program committee. As reviewing will be blind, please ensure that papers are anonymous. Self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...". Submissions will be judged on appropriateness, clarity, originality/innovativeness, correctness/soundness, meaningful comparison, significance and impact of ideas or results.
