## Submission information

Unless otherwise noted on the Call for Papers for the current edition of the workshop, we usually accept both short and long papers.
We also accept demo papers and papers describing systems associated with any shared task(s) co-located with the current edition of the NLP4CALL workshop.
Please indicate the relevant paper type at submission time.
The submissions must describe original and unpublished work.
All accepted papers will be collected into a proceedings volume to be published both in the NEALT Proceeding Series and through the ACL anthology.
Submissions must be sent through the electronic conference management system for that workshop, the link of which will be published both in the page and in the Call for Papers for that edition of the workshop.

Papers should describe original unpublished work or work-in-progress and will be peer-reviewed by at least two members of the program committee in a double-blind fashion.
System descriptions for shared tasks will be reviewed by the organizers of said shared task.
Self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...".
Submissions will be judged on appropriateness, clarity, originality/innovativeness, correctness/soundness, meaningful comparison, significance and impact of ideas or results.

The links to the Latex and Word templates can be found [below](#templates).


### Paper length

Papers sent to the NLP4CALL workshop must adhere to the following page limits:

- Short and demo papers must be between 4 and 7 pages.
- Long papers must be between 8 and 12 pages.
- Shared task papers must be in between 4 and 12 pages.

Other considerations regarding the paper length are as follows:

- Papers have can have an unlimited number of pages for references.
- Appendices are allowed and are not counted in the page count. However, the main body of the paper has to be self-contained. That is, the reviewers are not expected to look at them.
- Camera-ready versions of accepted papers will be given an additional page to address reviewer comments.


### Templates

The NLP4CALL workshop has used its own templates since the 2023 edition.
