This will cover our early experiments on trying to find low-ambiguity contexts, the follow-up work on generating challenging distractors, and finally the recently introduced gap-fill bundles.

[**Bente Ailin Svendsen**](http://www.hf.uio.no/multiling/english/people/core-group/benteas/index.html), University of Oslo

*   **Bio**: Bente Ailin Svendsen is Professor of Second Language Acquisition and Scandinavian Linguistics. She initiated and co-developed [MultiLing Multilingualism in Society across the Lifespan](http://www.hf.uio.no/multiling/english/), a Center of Excellence funded by the Research Council of Norway (RCN), where she was the Deputy Director 2013-2015. She has carried out research on multilingual socialisation, competence and use among children and adults; and on linguistic practices and identity constructions among young people in multilingual urban spaces.

*   **Talk**: _The Dynamics of Citizen Science in Exploring Language Diversity._
    
*   The objective of this paper is to explore the dynamics of citizen science (CS) in sociolinguistics, i.e. the involvement of non-professionals in doing sociolinguistic research, coined as Citizen Sociolinguistics (Rymes and Leone 2014, Svendsen, pending for review). In 2014, Norwegian pupils in all grades were invited to become citizen scientists through a national research campaign. Data from 4500 pupils reveal a vast linguistic diversity, an eagerness to learn languages, and a widespread use of English on a daily basis. The results, however, reflect prevailing hierarchical language regimes, firstly in the selection of specific ‘foreign’ languages offered and the desire of pupils to learn them, and secondly in the fact that the pupils’ home languages are not actively used in the classroom. This paper argues that one of the main advantages of Citizen Sociolinguistics is its wide-reaching potential and that it represents a method suited for collecting big data sets. Secondly, it is argued, based on a media analysis of the above CS-study, that CS has a potential to increase linguistic awareness and thus stimulating linguistic stewardship. However, CS raises some challenges for sociolinguistic research, ethically, as well as ontologically and epistemologically: what do CS-data represent and what claims can be made from them? Epistemologically, with a CS methodology, we are decentralising authority on who holds legitimate knowledge about language. Citizen Sociolinguistics is about opening the dialogue between ‘the academy’ and the ‘citizens’, it stimulates public engagement and it has a potential to advance the social impact of sociolinguistics.

**Description of the workshop**

For the second year in a row we are bringing two related themes of NLP for CALL and NLP for LA together. The goal of the joint workshop is to provide a meeting place for researchers working on language learning issues including both _empirical and experimental studies_ and _NLP-based applications_.

The **theme on Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Computer-Assisted Language Learning (NLP4CALL)** iis a meeting place for researchers working on the integration of Natural Language Processing and Speech Technologies in CALL systems and exploring the theoretical and methodological issues arising in this connection.

The intersection of Natural Language Processing and Speech/Dialogue Technology with Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) brings “understanding” of language to CALL tools, thus making CALL intelligent. This fact has given the name for this area of research – Intelligent CALL, ICALL. As the definition suggests, apart from having excellent knowledge of Natural Language Processing and/or Speech/Dialogue Technology, ICALL researchers need good insights into the second language acquisition (SLA) theories and practices, as well as knowledge of second language pedagogy and didactics. This workshop invites therefore all ICALL-relevant research, including studies where NLP-enriched tools are used for testing SLA and pedagogical theories, and vice versa, where SLA theories/pedagogical practices are modeled in ICALL tools.

The **workshop on Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Research in Language Acquisition (NLP4LA)** broadens the scope of this year’s joint workshop to also include theoretical, empirical, and experimental investigation of first, second and bilingual language acquisition.

We believe that this field will benefit from collaboration between the NLP, linguistics, psychology and cognitive science communities. The workshop is targeted at anyone interested in the relevance of computational techniques for first, second and bilingual language acquisition. Therefore, our aim is to bring together researchers from different fields with a shared interest in language acquisition.

The NLP4CALL&LA workshop series is aimed at bringing together competences from these areas for sharing experiences and brainstorming the future of the field.

**For the two tracks we welcome papers:**

*   that describe research directly aimed at ICALL
    
*   that demonstrate actual or discuss the potential use of existing Speech Technologies, NLP tools or resources for language learning
    
*   that describe the ongoing development of resources and tools with potential usage in ICALL, either directly in interactive applications, or indirectly in materials, application or curriculum development, e.g. collecting and annotating ICALL-relevant corpora; developing tools and algorithms for readability analysis, selecting optimal corpus examples, etc.
    
*   that discuss challenges and/or research agenda for ICALL
    
*   that describe empirical studies on language learner data
    
*   that describe computational models of first, second and bilingual language acquisition
    
*   that describe empirical or experimental studies, or computational models of various aspects of language and their effect in language comprehension and acquisition
    
*   that demonstrate actual or discuss the potential use of Speech Technologies, NLP tools or resources for investigating language acquisition
    
*   that describe psycholinguistic and socio-linguistic investigations on first, second and bilingual language acquisition
    

We especially invite submissions describing the above-mentioned themes for the Nordic languages; and papers that focus on different age groups, cultures, and language variation. We are also interested in software demonstrations.

  
**Submission information**

We will be using [Nodalida 2017 template](http://stp.lingfil.uu.se/~bea/nodalida17/) for the workshop this year. Authors are invited to submit long papers (8-12 pages) alternatively short papers (4-7 pages), page count not including references. Only pdf files will be accepted. Submissions will be managed through the electronic conference management system [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nlp4callnlp4la). Final camera-ready versions of accepted papers will be given an additional page to address reviewer comments.

Papers should describe original unpublished work or work-in-progress. Every paper will be reviewed by at least 2 members of the program committee. As reviewing will be blind, please ensure that papers are anonymous. Self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...". Submissions will be judged on appropriateness, clarity, originality/innovativeness, correctness/soundness, meaningful comparison, significance and impact of ideas or results.

All accepted papers will be collected into a proceedings volume to be submitted for publication in the NEALT Proceeding Series (Linköping Electronic Conference Proceedings) and, additionally, double-published through ACL anthology, following experiences from previous workshops, e.g. the [3rd NLP4CALL](http://aclanthology.info/events/ws-2015#W15-19).

This workshop follows a series of workshops on NLP for CALL organized by a Special Interest Group in Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Learning ([SIG-ICALL](http://spraakbanken.gu.se/swe/forskning/ICALL/SIG-ICALL) of NEALT). The workshop series has previously been financed by the [Center for Language Technology](http://clt.gu.se/) at the University of Gothenburg.

We intend to continue this workshop series, which up to date has been the only ICALL-relevant recurring event based in the Nordic countries. Our intention is to co-locate the workshop series with the two major LT events in Scandinavia, SLTC and Nodalida, thus making this workshop an annual event. Through this workshop, we intend to profile ICALL research in Nordic countries and to provide a dissemination venue for researchers active in this area.
