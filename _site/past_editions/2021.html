<p><strong>Title:</strong> What is an NLP NLP? Considerations from an L2 Assessment Perspective</p>

<p>Recent years have witnessed what feels like an exponential development in the scope and performance of NLP-approaches to human language. This is no less the case regarding the field of second language assessment, where NLP techniques seem likely to become ever more essential to, and integrated with, the assessment process. Indeed, surveying the recent progress of NLP, it seems hard to think of an assessment area where such techniques would not have genuine practical value. From an NLP-perspective, in other words, the future of NLP-informed assessment looks extremely bright. At the same time, it remains important to keep taking stock, especially where there is always a chance that techniques and applications will advance at a faster rate than our ability to properly conceptualise them. With that in mind, this talk offers a more philosophical perspective on the role of NLP in second language assessment, focusing on the question of what it might actually mean for something to be an “NLP NLP”; that is, a natural language processed, natural language profile. In general, it will explore the relationship between NLP and L2 profiles with regard to the wider notion of validity as a key assessment concept (Messick, 1989; Bachman &amp; Palmer, 1996; Weir, 2005; Kane, 2006); In particular, it will do so with regard to the specific validation framework utilised at Cambridge English (e.g. Shaw &amp; Weir, 2007), and with reference to some of our current principles and practice.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Challenges of Gamified Crowdsourcing for language learning applications</p>

<p>Gamification is defined (Deterding et al., 2011) as “the use of game design elements in non-game contexts” and it has been employed variously in the field of language learning. Gamified crowdsourcing is an increasing practice, and researchers explore creative methods of use in different domains (Morschheuser et al. 2017; Morschheuser and Hamari 2019; Murillo Zamorano et al. 2020) also with respect to the collection of language resources for language learning applications (Fort et al. 2018; Nicolas et al. 2020; Eryiğit, et al. 2021 among others) In this talk, I will present an overview of different types of gamified crowdsourcing and discuss the emerging opportunities and challenges of using it for language learning applications.</p>

<h2 id="description-of-the-workshop">Description of the workshop</h2>

<p>The workshop series on Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Computer-Assisted Language Learning (NLP4CALL) is a meeting place for researchers working on the integration of Natural Language Processing and Speech Technologies in CALL systems and exploring the theoretical and methodological issues arising in this connection. The latter includes, among others, insights from Second Language Acquisition (SLA) research, on the one hand, and promote development of “Computational SLA” through setting up Second Language research infrastructure(s), on the other.</p>

<p>The intersection of Natural Language Processing (or Language Technology / Computational Linguistics) and Speech Technology with Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) brings “understanding” of language to CALL tools, thus making CALL intelligent. This fact has given the name for this area of research – Intelligent CALL, ICALL. As the definition suggests, apart from having excellent knowledge of Natural Language Processing and/or Speech Technology, ICALL researchers need good insights into second language acquisition theories and practices, as well as knowledge of second language pedagogy and didactics. This workshop invites therefore a wide range of ICALL-relevant research, including studies where NLP-enriched tools are used for testing SLA and pedagogical theories, and vice versa, where SLA theories, pedagogical practices or empirical data are modeled in ICALL tools.</p>

<p>The NLP4CALL workshop series is aimed at bringing together competences from these areas for sharing experiences and brainstorming around the future of the field.</p>

<p>We welcome papers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>that describe research directly aimed at ICALL;</li>
  <li>that demonstrate actual or discuss the potential use of existing Language and Speech Technologies or resources for language learning;</li>
  <li>that describe the ongoing development of resources and tools with potential usage in ICALL, either directly in interactive applications, or indirectly in materials, application or curriculum development, e.g. learning material generation, assessment of learner texts and responses, individualized learning solutions, provision of feedback;</li>
  <li>that discuss challenges and/or research agenda for ICALL</li>
  <li>that describe empirical studies on language learner data.</li>
</ul>

<p>This year a special focus is given to work done on second language vocabulary and grammar profiling, as well as the use of crowdsourcing for creating, collecting and curating data in NLP projects.</p>

<p>We encourage paper presentations and software demonstrations describing the above-mentioned themes primarily, but not exclusively, for the Nordic languages.</p>

<h2 id="submission-information">Submission information</h2>

<p>This year we will use the NLP4CALL 2021 stylesheet for submissions. The author kit, containing LaTeX templates as well as Word template, can be downloaded from here:</p>

<p>The workshop series has been previously financed by the <a href="http://clt.gu.se/">Centre for Language Technology</a> (University of Gothenburg), the <a href="https://spraakbanken.gu.se/eng/swell_infra">SweLL project</a> (University of Gothenburg) and the Swedish Research Council’s conference grant. Currently the funding comes from <a href="https://spraakbanken.gu.se">Språkbanken-Text</a> and the <a href="https://spraakbanken.gu.se/eng/l2-profiling">L2 profiling project</a>.</p>

<p>For the past nine years we successfully co-located the NLP4CALL with the two major Language Technology events in Scandinavia, SLTC and NoDaLiDa, thus making this workshop an annual event. We intend to continue this tradition. Through this workshop, we intend to profile ICALL research in Nordic countries and to provide a dissemination venue for researchers active in this area.</p>
