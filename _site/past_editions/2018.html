<p><strong><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jbursteinets/">Jill Burstein</a></strong>, ETS</p>

<p>Jill Burstein is a Research Director of the Natural Language Processing Group in Research &amp; Development at Educational Testing Service in Princeton, New Jersey. Her research interests span Natural Language Processing for educational technology, automated essay scoring and evaluation, discourse and sentiment analysis, argumentation mining, education policy, English language learning, and writing research. The intersection of her interests has led to two extensively used commercial applications for English L2 learners: E-rater®, ETS’ automated essay evaluation application, and the Language Muse Activity PaletteTM – a new classroom tool under development targeting English learners that automatically generates language activities for classroom texts to support content comprehension. Jill Burstein is one of the most successful researchers within ICALL that together with a group of bright researchers made ICALL tools a reality for many teachers of L2 English.</p>

<p>Title: Natural Language Processing for Education: Applications for Reading and Writing Proficiency</p>

<p>Automated writing evaluation (or, AWE) systems have been largely used to support the measurement of writing skills for on-demand, large-volume, high-stakes assessments. Advances in natural language processing (NLP)-driven AWE now affords the ability, in real-time, to generate a variety of linguistic information which can provide support literacy for reading and writing. NLP-based technology can now be used to 1) build a broader array of capabilities to support the instruction for a diverse population of learners, and 2) offer educational analytics for various stakeholders, including students, instructors, parents, administrators and policy-makers. This talk will discuss the history of AWE, the literacy-based motivation and trajectory for AWE-driven technology development, two technology use cases of AWE-based reading (<a href="https://languagemuse.org/">The Language Muse® Activity Palette</a>) and writing applications (<a href="https://mentormywriting.org/">The Writing Mentor™</a>), and exploratory research examining relationships between linguistic features in college writing and broader success predictors that can potentially inform continued development of technology that supports literacy.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.uva.nl/profiel/h/u/j.h.hulstijn/j.h.hulstijn.html">Jan Hulstijn</a></strong>, UVA</p>

<p>Jan Hulstijn is professor emeritus of second language acquisition at the Amsterdam Center for Language and Communication (ACLC) of the University of Amsterdam. He has been affiliated with this university (full professor) since 1998. Before that he held positions at Leiden University and the Free University of Amsterdam. He was associate post-doc researcher at the University of Toronto, Canada (1982-1983) and he was visiting professor at the University of Leuven, Belgium, (2002) and at Stockholm University (2005). His main research interests are concerned with (1) language proficiency in native and non-native speakers; (2) explicit versus implicit accounts of first and second language learning and (3) theories of second language acquisition and philosophy of science. With others PIs, he received a number of research grants from the Netherlands Organisation of Scientific Research (NWO) between 1982 and 2007 (see webpage). In 2018 he received the 2018 distinguished scholar award from the European Second Language Association (EuroSLA) (http://www.eurosla.org/distinguished-scholar-award-2018-jan-h-hulstijn/). In 2015, he published a book presenting his theory of basic language cognition (BLC). His publication list can be downloaded from his webpage: http://www.uva.nl/profile/j.h.hulstijn.</p>

<p>Title: Usage-based views on second language acquisition and the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR): their potential relevance for the NLP field</p>

<p>The first wave of the Cognitive Revolution (1960 – 1985) was dominated by (1) the competence-performance distinction and Universal Grammar in generative linguistics, and by (2) notions of modularity and serial processing in psycholinguistics. These notions also dominated the scientific study of second language acquisition (SLA) at the time. In contrast, more recent work in SLA is increasingly being influenced by ideas which originated during the second wave of the Cognitive Revolution (1985 – the present), in particular usage-based linguistics, Emergentism and the Competition Model, Construction Grammar, Dynamic Systems Theory, implicit/statistical learning, and statistical learning in relation to corpus linguistics.</p>

<p>These developments might be important for people working in the field of NLP. In the first part of my talk I will give a brief overview of these more recent developments , with a particular focus on the unified conceptualization of representation and processing (referred to together with the term cognition), the notion of graded cognition (as opposed to dichotomous views of cognition), the notion of frequency and recency of linguistic elements in learners’ input (with the aid of corpus linguistics), the removal of traditional barriers between lexis and grammar, and the need to explain individual differences in language knowledge and use. In my view, current software for automatic analysis of corpora of spoken or written language production is still incapable of identifying grammatical constructions relevant from an SLA perspective. I will briefly introduce the notions of shared/basic and non-shared/extended language cognition (Hulstijn, 2015, 2018), which may also be useful for people in the NLP field. In the final part of my talk, I will present my views on the Common European Framework of Reference for Language (CEFR, 2001), which currently dominates almost all practices in second-language testing in Europe and increasingly in other parts of the world. There will be ample room for questions.</p>

<p><strong>Description of the workshop</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>theme on Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Computer-Assisted Language Learning (NLP4CALL)</strong> is a meeting place for researchers working on the integration of Natural Language Processing and Speech Technologies in CALL systems and exploring the theoretical and methodological issues arising in this connection.</p>

<p>The intersection of Natural Language Processing and Speech/Dialogue Technology with Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) brings “understanding” of language to CALL tools, thus making CALL intelligent. This fact has given the name for this area of research – Intelligent CALL, ICALL. As the definition suggests, apart from having excellent knowledge of Natural Language Processing and/or Speech/Dialogue Technology, ICALL researchers need good insights into the second language acquisition (SLA) theories and practices, as well as knowledge of second language pedagogy and didactics. This workshop invites therefore all ICALL-relevant research, including studies where NLP-enriched tools are used for testing SLA and pedagogical theories, and vice versa, where SLA theories/pedagogical practices are modeled in ICALL tools.</p>

<p>The latter includes , among others, insights from Second Language Acquisition (SLA) research, on the one hand, and promote development of “Computational SLA” through setting up Second Language research infrastructure(s), on the other .</p>

<p>The intersection of Natural Language Processing (or Language Technology / Computational Linguistics) and Speech Technology with Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) brings “understanding” of language to CALL tools, thus making CALL intelligent. This fact has given the name for this area of research – Intelligent CALL, ICALL. As the definition suggests, apart from having excellent knowledge of Natural Language Processing and/or Speech Technology, ICALL researchers need good insights into second language acquisition theories and practices, as well as knowledge of second language pedagogy and didactics. This workshop invites therefore a wide range of ICALL-relevant research, including studies where NLP-enriched tools are used for testing SLA and pedagogical theories, and vice versa, where SLA theories, pedagogical practices or empirical data are modeled in ICALL tools.</p>

<p>The NLP4CALL workshop series is aimed at bringing together competences from these areas for sharing experiences and brainstorming around the future of the field.</p>

<p><strong>We welcome papers:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>that describe research directly aimed at ICALL;</li>
  <li>that demonstrate actual or discuss the potential use of existing Language and Speech Technologies or resources for language learning;</li>
  <li>that describe the ongoing development of resources and tools with potential usage in ICALL, either directly in interactive applications, or indirectly in materials, application or curriculum development, e.g. learning material generation, assessment of learner texts/responses, individualized learning solutions, provision of feedback;</li>
  <li>that discuss challenges and/or research agenda for ICALL;</li>
  <li>that describe empirical studies on language learner data</li>
</ul>

<p>A special focus is given to the established and upcoming infrastructures aimed at SLA and learner corpus research, covering questions such as data collection, legal issues, reliability of annotation, annotation tool development, search environments for SLA-relevant data, etc.</p>

<p>We encourage paper presentations and software demonstrations describing the above-mentioned themes primarily, but not exclusively, for the Nordic languages.</p>

<p>This workshop follows a series of workshops on NLP for CALL organized by a Special Interest Group in Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Learning (<a href="http://spraakbanken.gu.se/swe/forskning/ICALL/SIG-ICALL">SIG-ICALL</a> of NEALT). The workshop series has previously been financed by the <a href="http://clt.gu.se/">Center for Language Technology</a> at the University of Gothenburg.</p>

<p>We intend to continue this workshop series, which up to date has been the only ICALL-relevant recurring event based in the Nordic countries. Our intention is to co-locate the workshop series with the two major LT events in Scandinavia, SLTC and Nodalida, thus making this workshop an annual event. Through this workshop, we intend to profile ICALL research in Nordic countries and to provide a dissemination venue for researchers active in this area.</p>
