<h2 id="invited-speakers">Invited speakers</h2>

<p>This year we have the pleasure to welcome two invited speakers: <strong><a href="https://perso.uclouvain.be/magali.paquot/">Magali Paquot</a></strong></p>

<p>Dr Magali Paquot is an FNRS research associate at the Centre for English Corpus Linguistics, UCLouvain. She specializes in the use of learner corpora to study key topics in SLA and is particularly interested in methodological issues. She is co-editor in chief of the International Journal of Learner Corpus Research and one of the founding members of the Learner Corpus Research Association.</p>

<p>Her most recent publications were published in the International Journal of Learner Corpus Research, Language Assessment Quarterly and Second Language Research. She also co-edited A Practical Handbook of Corpus Linguistics (with S. Th. Gries; Springer, in press) and the Routledge Handbook of Second Language Acquisition and Corpora (with N. Tracy-Ventura, submitted).</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Crowdsourcing as a means to democratize access to L2 enriched data: the case of L2 proficiency</p>

<p>The success of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Computer-Assisted Language Learning (NLP4CALL) projects is often dependent on the quality of its primary L2 data. One variable that is essential for the development of CALL systems, yet very time-consuming and costly, is foreign language proficiency (Ballier et al. 2020). In Second Language Acquisition, its measurement has also not always received the attention it deserves, and practices of proficiency level assignment have been the subject of continued criticism (e.g. Hulstijn et al. 2010). In this talk, I will report on the first results of the Crowdsourcing Language Assessment Project (CLAP), which aims to investigate whether crowdsourcing can offer practical solutions to the time and cost difficulties often associated with foreign language proficiency assessment. More specifically, CLAP explores whether and how a crowd of people can be used to assess learner texts reliably and validly. In its current design, the project relies on an adaptive comparative judgement task (Pollitt, 2012).</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/research-and-validation/meet-the-team/mark-brenchley/">Mark Brenchley</a></strong></p>

<p>Dr Mark Brenchley is Senior Research Manager at Cambridge Assessment English. Mark manages research supporting the development and validation of Cambridge English products in the areas of speaking and writing, as well as vocabulary and grammar more broadly. He specialises in the application of corpus-based methodologies and is responsible for maintaining and developing the company’s internal corpus architecture, including the Cambridge Learner Corpus. His current work, in particular, focuses on the development and validation of auto-marking technologies.</p>

<p>Mark holds a PhD in Education from the University of Exeter, where he explored the development of spoken and written syntax within the English education system. Following his PhD, he co-developed the Growth in Grammar Corpus, a novel corpus of student writing that covers the primary and secondary phases of the English education system.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> What is an NLP NLP? Considerations from an L2 Assessment Perspective</p>

<p>Recent years have witnessed what feels like an exponential development in the scope and performance of NLP-approaches to human language. This is no less the case regarding the field of second language assessment, where NLP techniques seem likely to become ever more essential to, and integrated with, the assessment process. Indeed, surveying the recent progress of NLP, it seems hard to think of an assessment area where such techniques would not have genuine practical value. From an NLP-perspective, in other words, the future of NLP-informed assessment looks extremely bright. At the same time, it remains important to keep taking stock, especially where there is always a chance that techniques and applications will advance at a faster rate than our ability to properly conceptualise them. With that in mind, this talk offers a more philosophical perspective on the role of NLP in second language assessment, focusing on the question of what it might actually mean for something to be an “NLP NLP”; that is, a natural language processed, natural language profile. In general, it will explore the relationship between NLP and L2 profiles with regard to the wider notion of validity as a key assessment concept (Messick, 1989; Bachman &amp; Palmer, 1996; Weir, 2005; Kane, 2006); In particular, it will do so with regard to the specific validation framework utilised at Cambridge English (e.g. Shaw &amp; Weir, 2007), and with reference to some of our current principles and practice.</p>

<h2 id="description-of-the-workshop">Description of the workshop</h2>

<p>The workshop series on Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Computer-Assisted Language Learning (NLP4CALL) is a meeting place for researchers working on the integration of Natural Language Processing and Speech Technologies in CALL systems and exploring the theoretical and methodological issues arising in this connection. The latter includes, among others, insights from Second Language Acquisition (SLA) research, on the one hand, and promote development of “Computational SLA” through setting up Second Language research infrastructure(s), on the other.</p>

<p>The intersection of Natural Language Processing (or Language Technology / Computational Linguistics) and Speech Technology with Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) brings “understanding” of language to CALL tools, thus making CALL intelligent. This fact has given the name for this area of research – Intelligent CALL, ICALL. As the definition suggests, apart from having excellent knowledge of Natural Language Processing and/or Speech Technology, ICALL researchers need good insights into second language acquisition theories and practices, as well as knowledge of second language pedagogy and didactics. This workshop invites therefore a wide range of ICALL-relevant research, including studies where NLP-enriched tools are used for testing SLA and pedagogical theories, and vice versa, where SLA theories, pedagogical practices or empirical data are modeled in ICALL tools.</p>

<p>The NLP4CALL workshop series is aimed at bringing together competences from these areas for sharing experiences and brainstorming around the future of the field.</p>

<p>We welcome papers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>that describe research directly aimed at ICALL;</li>
  <li>that demonstrate actual or discuss the potential use of existing Language and Speech Technologies or resources for language learning;</li>
  <li>that describe the ongoing development of resources and tools with potential usage in ICALL, either directly in interactive applications, or indirectly in materials, application or curriculum development, e.g. learning material generation, assessment of learner texts and responses, individualized learning solutions, provision of feedback;</li>
  <li>that discuss challenges and/or research agenda for ICALL</li>
  <li>that describe empirical studies on language learner data.</li>
</ul>

<p>This year a special focus is given to work done on second language vocabulary and grammar profiling, as well as the use of crowdsourcing for creating, collecting and curating data in NLP projects.</p>

<p>We encourage paper presentations and software demonstrations describing the above-mentioned themes primarily, but not exclusively, for the Nordic languages.</p>

<p>The workshop series has been previously financed by the <a href="http://clt.gu.se/">Centre for Language Technology</a> (University of Gothenburg), the <a href="https://spraakbanken.gu.se/eng/swell_infra">SweLL project</a> (University of Gothenburg) and the Swedish Research Council’s conference grant. Currently the funding comes from <a href="https://spraakbanken.gu.se">Språkbanken-Text</a> and the <a href="https://spraakbanken.gu.se/eng/l2-profiling">L2 profiling project</a>.</p>

<p>For the past eight years we successfully co-located the NLP4CALL with the two major Language Technology events in Scandinavia, SLTC and NoDaLiDa, thus making this workshop an annual event. We intend to continue this tradition. Through this workshop, we intend to profile ICALL research in Nordic countries and to provide a dissemination venue for researchers active in this area.</p>
